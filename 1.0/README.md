# Base Converter

### Welcome!
This tool converts numbers between bases from 1 - 36. Digits are 0 - Z. It works with fractional numbers as well as integers, but not negatives. Bases are always entered in base 10. Please note that fractional numbers are not rounded, they are simply truncated to the desired number of digits.

### Instructions
In the Fractional Digits box, enter the number of digits you would like after the radix point. On the left, enter the original number and base. On the right, enter the base to which you want to convert. Then press Convert to get the converted number.
